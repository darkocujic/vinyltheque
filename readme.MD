# VINYLTHEQUE

Vinyltheque was made when I needed a way to catalogue my vinyl collection. It's not big but you still need a way to manage around. And, why not.

## How-To

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS v18

### Instructions

0. clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone <https or ssh link>
   ```

1. install npm in backend and frontend

   ```bash
   npm ci
   cd client
   npm ci
   ```

2. modify environment variables

   ```bash
   cd <project-root>
   cp .env.sample .env
   # edit file contents
   ```

3. start everything

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev # for development or
   npm run start:prod # for production use
   ```
